(Phase Lines & Direction Fields)

# Direction Field
Fields from BC.

For
$$
\frac{du}{dt} = 2 - 2u
$$

# Autonomous DEs
**Autonomous differential equations** are of the form
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
$$
Very easy to find the equilibrium points of.

# Equilibrium points
An **equilibrium solution** (or **critical points**, **fixed points**, **stationary points**, **steady-state points**) for a DE in $y(t)$ satisfies $y = \text{constant}$.
- i.e. $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.
- Used in optimization problems :D

Classifications:
|classification|interpretation|
|-|-|
|stable equilibrium point|solution curves, close to & on either side of $y_1$, tend to $y_1$ (converge) as $t \to \infty$
|unstable equilibrium point|solution curves, close to & on either side of $y_1$, tend away from $y_1$ (diverge) as $t \to \infty$|
|semi-stable equilibrium point|solution curves, close to & on one side of $y_1$, tends to $y_1$ as $t \to \infty$ and away on the other side|

# Phase Line
**Phase line** (or **phase portrait**) is a number line that indicates where solutions tend towards.

## Example
Suppose $\frac{dy}{dt} = \overbrace{y(y - 1)(y - 2)}^{f(y)}$, $y(0) \geq 0$, $t \geq 0$.
1. The equilibrium points: $y = 0, 1, 2$
2. Sketch $f(y)$ vs $y$.

3. Use (1) and (2) to sketch phase line.

4. Use (1), (2), (3) to sketch a few solution curves (aka **integral curves**) for the DE.
	- At $y = 0, 1, 2$, $\frac{dy}{dt}$ is 0, so it should be horizontal at those points. $\frac{dy}{dt}$ on $u \in (0, 1)$ is positive, so $y$ is increasing. etc.
