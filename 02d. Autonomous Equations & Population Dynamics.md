# Concavity of Autonomous Equations
Recall [[01b. Qualitative Methods#Autonomous DEs|Autonomous DEs]].

Note that
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \frac{df}{dy} \frac{dy}{dt}
$$
* Concave up if df/dy, dy/dt same signs
* Concave down if df/dy, dy/dt different signs

# Example 1
Population obeys logistic equation:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = ry\left(\frac{1-y}{K}\right)
$$

1. Sketch $f$ vs $y$, identify and classify the equilibrium points of $y$.
2. For $y \in \mathbb{R}$, determine whether y is concave up or concave down.
3. Use the information in parts (a), (b) to sketch integral curves of the DE.

# Example 2
A population obeys the DE $y' = a - y^2$ for a parameter $a$.
1. Determine the equilibrium points for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$. There are 3 cases.
2. Sketch the phase lines for each case and classify the critical points.
3. For the case when $a > 0$, sketch a few solution curves.
4. Sketch the location of the critical point as a function of $a$ in an $ay$-plane. This is known as a **bifurcation** diagram.
