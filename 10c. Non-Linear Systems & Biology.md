# Logistic Growth

Logistic growth can be represented with
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}= x(\varepsilon - \sigma x),
$$
where:
- $\varepsilon$ is a growth rate
- $\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$ is a saturation level
- $(\varepsilon - \sigma x)$ represents the environmental capacity for a species (such as food supply)
- $x(t)$ represents the population of **one species** at time t.

# Competing Species (7.3)

Suppose there are two species that do not interact directly but compete for the same food supply.

We could use two logistic equations...
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= x(\varepsilon_1 - \sigma_1 x)\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= y(\varepsilon_2 - \sigma_2 y),
\end{align*}
$$
but this fails to consider the same, limited food source.

Thus, we can include a term to associate the two...
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= x(\varepsilon_1 - \sigma_1 x - \alpha_1y)\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= y(\varepsilon_2 - \sigma_2 y - \alpha_2x).
\end{align*}
$$

# Predator-Prey Model (7.4)

Suppose that we have two species that interact directly with each other, with the assumptions...
- $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are their population
- $y$ preys on $x$
- without prey, $y$ dies out ($y' = -Cy, C > 0$)
- without predators, $x$ grows exponentially ($x' = Ax, A > 0$)
- the number of encounters is proportional to $xy$

The **Lotka-Volterra** equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= Ax - \alpha xy\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= -Cx + \gamma xy
\end{align*}
$$
