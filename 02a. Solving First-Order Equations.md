# Separable Equations (2.1)

Same as from BC.
A first-order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written as
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y) = p(x)q(y)
$$
where $p$, $q$ are functions.

Integration is done to solve:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= p(x)q(y)\\
\frac{1}{q(y)}dy &= p(x)dx\\
\int\frac{1}{q(y)}dy &= \int p(x)dx
\end{align*}
$$

# Solving First-Order Linear Differential Equations (2.2)

Recall [[01c. Classifying Differential Equations#Standard Form|the standard form for a first-order linear DE]]:
$$y' + p(t)y = g(t)$$

We multiply each side by an integrating factor $\mu = e^{\int p(t)dt}$. 
(Note that the integration constant is irrelevant for $\mu$).

By doing so, we get
$$
\mu y' + \mu p(t)y = \mu g(t).
$$
The left-hand-side simplifies, leaving:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}(\mu y) = \mu g.
$$

\begin{align*}
t^2 \frac{dy}{dt} + 2ty &= 4t^2\\

\begin{align*}
t^2y &= \int 4t^2 dt\\
t^2y &= \frac{4}{3}t^3 + C\\
y &= \frac{4}{3}t + \frac{C}{t^2}
