# Separable Equations (2.1)

Same as from BC.
A first-order differential equation is **separable** if it can be written as
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y) = p(x)q(y)
$$
where $p$, $q$ are functions.

Integration is done to solve:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= p(x)q(y)\\
\frac{1}{q(y)}dy &= p(x)dx\\
\int\frac{1}{q(y)}dy &= \int p(x)dx
\end{align*}
$$

# Solving First-Order Linear Differential Equations (2.2)
Linear first-order ODE: $a_1 y' + a_0 y = a_r$

In standard form:
$$\frac{dy}{dt} + ay = b$$
## Example
$ty' + 2y = 4t$ ($t \geq 0$).

Note that the example is NOT separable.

### Solving
Standard form: $t \neq 0$
$$
y' + \frac{2}{t}y = 4
$$

To solve, we multiply both sides by a *magical* integrating factor:
$$
\mu = e^{\int \frac{2}{t}dt} = e^{2 \ln t} = t^2
$$
Note that the integrand is the coefficient of the y-term.

The equation becomes:
$$
t^2 \frac{dy}{dt} + 2ty = 4t^2
$$
LHS can be combined back into a product rule:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}(t^2y) = 4t^2
$$
Then, integrate:
$$
\begin{align*}
\int 4t^2 dt &= t^2y\\
\frac{4}{3}t^3 + C = t^2y\\
y = \frac{4}{3}t + \frac{C}{t^2}
\end{align*}
$$
(Note, $t \neq 0$)

If $t = 0$, $0y' + 2y = 4 \cdot 0$, so $y = 0$.

### Why?
General linear first-order ODE:
$$y' + f(t)y = g(t)$$
The integrating factor:
$$\mu = e^{\int f(t)dt}$$

Then:
$$
\begin{align*}
\mu(t) \frac{dy}{dt} + \mu(t) f(t)y &= \mu(t) g(t)\\
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\mu(t) y\right) &= \mu(t) g(t)\\
\mu(t)y &= \int \mu(t) g(t)dt
\end{align*}

$$
