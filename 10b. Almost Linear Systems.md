## Isolated Critical Points (ICPs)

Note that almost linear systems can only be applied around an **isolated critical point**. A critical point is considered *isolated* if there is some circle around the given critical point such that there are no other critical points.
(i.e., there are no lines or curves of critical points)

We can describe a non-linear autonomous system as
$$
\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g.
$$
(Note that $A\vec x$ is the linear part of $\vec x'$, $\vec g$ is the non-linear part of $\vec x'$.)

If $\vec x_0$ is an ICP of this system, it is **also** an ICP of $\vec x' = A\vec x$, assuming $\det A \ne 0$.

## Definition of Almost Linear System

Suppose
$$
\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g,
$$
where $A$ is a matrix with constant coefficients (and $\det A \ne 0$), and $\vec g$ is a non-linear function of $\vec x$.

We can consider the system almost linear near $\vec x = \vec 0$ if:
- $\vec x = \vec 0$ is an isolated critical point
- $\frac{\|\vec g\|}{\|\vec x\|} \to \vec 0$, as $\vec x \to \vec x_0.$ (i.e., $\vec g$ approaches $\vec 0$ faster than $\vec x$ approaches $\vec 0$.)

We can also extend this arbitrarily. A system is almost linear near $\vec x = \vec x_0$ if:
- $\vec x = \vec x_0$ is an isolated critical point
- $\frac{\|\vec g\|}{\|\vec x - \vec x_0\|} \to \vec 0$, as $\vec x \to \vec x_0.$ (i.e., $\vec g$ approaches $\vec 0$ faster than $\vec x$ approaches $\vec x_0$.)

## Almost Linear Systems using Jacobian

Consider a given autonomous system
$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= F(x,y)\\
y' &= G(x, y),
\end{align*}
$$
with an ICP at $\vec x_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.

Then, we can describe the system as
$$
\vec x' = J(\vec x - \vec x_0) + \vec \eta,
$$
where: 
* $J$ is the **Jacobian matrix** $\begin{bmatrix}F_x & F_y \\ G_x & G_y\end{bmatrix}$, computed at $\vec x = \vec x_0$,
* $\vec \eta$ is a vector describing the quadratic (and beyond) terms for the Taylor expansions of $F$ and $G$.

Near the ICP $\vec x_0,$ this system can be approximated as
$$
\vec x' \approx J (\vec x - \vec x_0).
$$
(Assuming $\det J \ne 0$ at $\vec x = \vec x_0$.)

## Test for Almost Linear Systems

Consider a given autonomous system
$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= F(x,y)\\
y' &= G(x, y),
\end{align*}
$$
with an ICP at $\vec x_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.

If $F$ and $G$ are twice differentiable, the system is almost linear (because it can be Jacobian-ified).

# Effect of Small Perturbations

Suppose $$\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g,$$where $\vec x_0$ is an ICP and $\vec g \ne 0.$

Because the linear system only *approximates* the linear system, the eigenvalues of the almost linear system only *approximate* the linear system's eigenvalues.

For most systems, this difference is negligible. However, there are two cases where it can result in a difference in behavior or stability: pure imaginary $\lambda$ and real repeated $\lambda$.

## Pure Imaginary $\lambda$

Ideally, if a linear system has $\lambda = \pm i \beta$, there is a center around the critical point.
However due to perturbations, the approximate $\lambda = \pm i \beta$ shifts to $\lambda = \alpha' \pm i \beta'$.

Here, $\alpha' \approx 0, \beta' \approx \beta$.
This can cause a change in stability AND behavior.
* If $\alpha' > 0$, then the almost linear system has an *unstable* spiral source.
* If $\alpha' = 0$, then the almost linear system has a *stable* center.
* If $\alpha' < 0$, then the almost linear system has an *asymptotically stable* spiral sink.

## Real Repeated $\lambda$

Ideally, if a linear system has repeated eigenvalues $\lambda = \alpha$, then there is a [[03d. Phase Portraits#Repeated Eigenvalues|proper or improper node]]. However due to perturbations, the approximate $\lambda = \alpha$ shifts to $\lambda = \alpha' \pm i \beta'$.

Here, $\alpha' \approx \alpha, \beta' \approx 0$.
This does not change the stability, but it does change the behavior.

## Table of Changes

| $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$              | linear system behavior | stability | almost linear system behavior         | stability     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 > 0$         | proper/improper node   | unstable  | nodal or spiral source                | unstable      |
| $\lambda = \lambda_2 < 0$           | proper/improper node   | a. stable | nodal or spiral sink                | a. stable     |
| $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 = \pm i\beta$ | center                 | stable    | center, spiral source, or spiral sink | indeterminate |

For systems with eigenvalues that don't match these two conditions, the linear system & almost linear systems maintain the same behavior. Those tables can be found [[03d. Phase Portraits|here]].
