# Isolated Critical Points (ICP)

For a given system, a critical point is considered an **isolated critical point** if there is some circle around the given critical point such that there are no other critical points.

Suppose $$\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g,$$where $\vec x = \vec 0$ is a critical point and $\det A \ne 0$.

Then, $\vec 0$ is an isolated critical point of the system as well as $\vec x' = A\vec x.$

# Almost Linear Systems

Almost linear systems are a method of creating linear approximations to non-linear systems.

## Almost Linear Systems near $\vec x = \vec 0$

A given system $$\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g$$is almost linear near $\vec x = \vec 0$ if:
- $\vec x = \vec 0$ is a critical point
- $\frac{\|\vec g\|}{\|\vec x\|} \to \vec 0$, as $\vec x \to 0.$ ($\|\vec g\|$ tends towards $\vec 0$ faster than $\|\vec 0\|$.)

## Almost Linear Systems elsewhere

Consider a given autonomous system
$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= F(x,y)\\
y' &= G(x, y),
\end{align*}
$$
with an ICP at $\vec x_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.

Then, we can describe the system as
$$
\vec x' = J\vec x + \vec \eta,
$$
where $J$ is the **Jacobian matrix** $\begin{bmatrix}F_x & F_y \\ G_x & G_y\end{bmatrix}$, computed at $\vec x = \vec x_0$,
and $\vec \eta$ is a vector describing the quadratic (and beyond) terms for the Taylor expansions of $F$ and $G$.

Near the ICP $\vec x_0,$ this system can be approximated as
$$
\vec x' \approx J\vec x.
$$
(Assume $\det J \ne 0$ at $\vec x = \vec x_0$ so that $\vec x_0$ also is an ICP of the linear approximation.)

## Test for Almost Linear Systems
Consider a given autonomous system
$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= F(x,y)\\
y' &= G(x, y),
\end{align*}
$$
with an ICP at $\vec x_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.

If $F$ and $G$ are twice differentiable, the system is almost linear (because it can be Jacobian-ified).

# Effect of Small Perturbations

Suppose $$\vec x' = A\vec x + \vec g,$$where $\vec x_0$ is an ICP and $\vec g \ne 0.$

The type of critical point & stability of the **linear system** and **almost linear system** are usually the same, except for
- when the eigenvalues of $A$ are pure imaginary (center),
- when the eigenvalues of $A$ are real repeated.

In these cases, $\vec g$ is not negligible and may result in small changes in the eigenvalues which result in varying behavior.
