# Importance of Classification
- Many different methods for solving DEs
- All methods for solving DEs only work for *certain* types of DEs
- Classification helps discern which methods are the best to use

# Classifications
## ODEs & PDEs
- **Ordinary differential equations (ODE)**: Dependent variables in DE only depend on 1 independent variable
- Example: $$y=y(t)\quad\frac{dy}{dt}=-k(y -T)$$
- **Partial differential equations (PDE)**: Dependent variable(s) depend on more than one independent variable.
- Example: $$y=y(x,t)\quad\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{t}} = k \frac{\partial^2{y}}{\partial{x}^2}$$
## Order
The **order** of an ODE is the highest degree derivative which appears in the equation.

$u'' + 2u' = u^3 + t^4$ is a 2nd-order ODE because the highest derivative is the 2nd.

## Linear
An $n^{th}$ order **linear ODE** takes the form:
$$\sum_{k=0}^n a_k(t)u^{(n-k)}(t)=g(t)$$
where $a_k(t)$ and $g(t)$ are given, $u(t)$ is unknown.

In long form:
$$
a_0(t)u^{(n)}(t) + a_1(t)u^{(n - 1)}(t) + \ldots + a_{n - 1}(t)u'(t) + a_n(t)u(t) = g(t)
$$
A DE that is not of this form is **non-linear**
- The coefficients are not just functions of $t$.

### Linear Constant Coefficient ODEs
Linear ODE where all $a_k$ are constants.

### Homogeneous & Inhomogeneous Linear ODEs
- If $g(t) = 0$, linear ODE is **homogeneous**.
- Else, it is **inhomogeneous**.

# Standard Form
The general first-order linear equation is of the form:
$$
a_0 \frac{dy}{dt} + a_1 y = g(t)
$$

In standard form, the $dy/dt$ term has a coefficient of 1: $$
\frac{dy}{dt} + py = g
$$
(Note that $p(t) = \frac{a_1(t)}{a_0(t)}$, $g(t) = \frac{h(t)}{a_0(t)}$ when $a_0(t) \neq 0$)
(In the cases where $a_0(t) = 0$, just solve lol)
