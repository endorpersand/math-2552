# Initial Value Problem (IVPs)
Given an IVP, we may consider:
- **existence**: Does the IVP have a solution, and if so, where?
- **uniqueness**: Is the solution unique?

# Theorems

## Existence & Uniqueness of 1st Order Linear IVPs
If $p$ and $g$ are continuous on $(\alpha, \beta)$, $t_0 \in (\alpha, \beta)$, then there is a **unique** solution to the IVP
$$
y' + p(t)y = g(t),\quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

### Why?

Consider the [[02a. Solving First-Order Equations#Solving First-Order Linear Differential Equations (2.2)|FOLDE solution]]:

Let $\mu$ be the integrating factor. We can solve the above IVP into...
$$\mu(t) y = \int {\mu(t) g(t) dt} + c$$

Our integration constant for $\mu$'s integral is arbitrary, so we can instead define $\mu$ as...
$$
\mu(t) = e^{\int_{t_0}^t p(s)ds}
$$
By doing so, $\mu(t_0) = 1$. We can integrate as long as the function is continuous, which means $p(s)$ must be continuous for the interval $t_0$ resides in... which is $(\alpha, \beta).$

Solving for y:
$$
y = \frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left(\int_{t_0}^t{\mu(s) g(s) ds} + c\right)
$$
When we substitute $t = t_0$, we find $y = y_0$. Hence,
$$
y = \frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left(\int_{t_0}^t{\mu(s) g(s) ds} + y_0\right)
$$

### Example
$$
(9 - t)^2y' + 5ty = 3t^2,\ y(-1) = 1
$$
In standard form:
$$
y' - \frac{5t}{(3-t)(3+t)}y = \frac{3t^2}{9-t^2}
$$
Then, $t_0 = -1$, an interval where a solution exists would be $(-3, 3).$

- There will be an explicit expression.
- Points where there are discontinuities can be identified from the coefficients.

## Existence & Uniqueness of 1st Order Non-Linear IVPs

If $f$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are continuous over $t \in (\alpha, \beta)$ and $y \in (\gamma, \delta)$, which contains $(t_0, y_0)$, then there is a unique solution to the IVP:
$$
y' = f(t, y),\quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$
on $t \in (\alpha, \beta)$.

- Sufficient but not necessary.
