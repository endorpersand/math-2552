**Textbook sections**: 1.2
This section explores *phase lines* and *direction fields*.

# Direction Fields
Exactly the same as direction fields from BC.

> [!Example]+
> Here is the direction field for $\frac{du}{dt} = 2 - 2u$.

# Autonomous DEs

**Autonomous differential equations** are of the form
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
$$
Very easy to find the equilibrium points of.

# Equilibrium Points

An **equilibrium solution** (or **critical points**, **fixed points**, **stationary points**, **steady-state points**) for a DE in $y(t)$ satisfies $y = \text{constant}$.
- i.e. $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.
- Used in optimization problems :D

## Classifications for Equilibria in Autonomous Equations

| classification        | intepretation                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| asymptotically stable | solution curves close to & on either side of $y_1$ converge as $t \to \infty$                 |
| unstable              | solution curves close to & on either side of $y_1$, diverge as $t \to \infty$                 |
| semi-stable           | solution curves close to & on one side converges as $t \to \infty$ and away on the other side |

# Phase Lines
**Phase line** (or **phase portrait**) is a number line that indicates where solutions tend towards.

> [!Example]
> Suppose $\frac{dy}{dt} = \overbrace{y(y - 1)(y - 2)}^{f(y)}$, $y(0) \geq 0$, $t \geq 0$.
> 1. The equilibrium points: $y = 0, 1, 2$
> 2. Sketch $f(y)$ vs $y$.
>	- ![[01b-3-yf-sketch.png]]
> 3. Use (1) and (2) to sketch phase line.
>	- ![[01b-2-phase-line.png]]
> 4. Use (1), (2), (3) to sketch a few solution curves (aka **integral curves**) for the DE.
>	- At $y = 0, 1, 2$, $\frac{dy}{dt}$ is 0, so it should be horizontal at those points. $\frac{dy}{dt}$ on $u \in (0, 1)$ is positive, so $y$ is increasing. etc.
